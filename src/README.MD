## 📷 How to Add Screenshots

1. **Take a screenshot** of your app (e.g., using Snipping Tool, Print Screen, or your OS screenshot tool).
2. **Save the image** in your project, for example in a folder called `assets` at the root or inside `public`.
3. **Reference the image in your README:**

   ```markdown
   ![Description](./assets/your-screenshot.png)
   ```

   If you use the `public` folder, you can also reference as:

   ```markdown
   ![Description](/assets/your-screenshot.png)
   ```

4. **Commit the image and README.md** to your repository.
